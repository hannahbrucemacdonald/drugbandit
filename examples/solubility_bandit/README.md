Hydration free energy bandit
=====================================
This directory contains example of bayesian bandit to optimise toward simulating
the most soluble ligand of a set.

Contains input for eight substituted benzene molecules from the FreeSolv dataset.
Jupyter notebook contains code to run a multi-armed Bandit sampling from the known experimental values, and sampling using short YANK simulations
